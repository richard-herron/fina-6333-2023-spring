# Introduction

Welcome to FINA 6333 for Spring 2023!

## Website

I will maintain our notebooks on this website because Canvas does not render notebooks.
This website renders our notebooks and offers several ways to interact:

1. Open and run them on an *ad hoc* JupyterLab server by clicking the rocket in the upper-right corner of each page (this page is not a notebook, so you cannot open and run it)
1. Download them by clicking the down arrow in the upper-right corner of each page
1. Visit their GitHub repository by clicking the cat in the upper-right corner of each page

This GitHub repository (<https://github.com/richard-herron/fina-6333-2023-spring>) also generates this website.
If GitHub intimidates you, you can ignore our GitHub repository and download our notebooks one at a time, as I describe above in option 1.
If GitHub does not intimidate you, you can use our GitHub repository in a few ways:

1. Fork it and maintain a personal repository that you update throughout the semester
1. Create issues for each notebook when you have questions and comments

## Notebooks

Each course topic has one notebook for its lecture and one for its practice exercises.
So we will typically have one notebook per chapter in {cite:t}`mckinney2022python` and {cite:t}`welch2022corporate`.
I plan to "flip the classroom" this semester, which means:

1. Each week, I will record a short lecture based on the lecture notebook
1. Before class, you will watch this short lecture, review the lecture notebook, and read the textbook
1. During class, we will work through the practice exercise notebook together
1. After class, I will update and post these notebooks, and you will complete DataCamp courses, quizzes, and projects to reinforce what we learn

I will maintain these notebooks on this website but everything else on Canvas (and Gradescope). 

## JupyterLab

I suggest you run JupyterLab on Research Computing's Open OnDemand (OOD) service: <https://ood.discovery.neu.edu>.
This service is fast, reliable, available everywhere, and can access a shared folder of course notebooks.
You can log into OOD with your Northeastern username and password and start a JupyterLab session under "My Interactive Sessions".

You can also install Anaconda on your laptop to run JupyterLab or use DataCamp Workspaces.
There are more ways to run JupyterLab and even more ways to interact with Python, and I am happy to help you during office hours.
However, we will only use JupyterLab in class, and OOD is the easiest way to use JupyterLab.

***Update:*** Halfway through the semester, OOD has proven to be slow and unreliable at the scale of this course.
Instead, I suggest you install Anaconda on your laptop or use DataCamp Workspaces.
