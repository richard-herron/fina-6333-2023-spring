# ##  Practice

# ### Plot the security market line (SML) for a variety of asset classes

# Use the past three years of daily data for the following exhange traded funds (ETFs):
# 
# 1. SPY (SPDR---Standard and Poor's Depository Receipts---ETF for the S&P 500 index)
# 1. BIL (SPDR ETF for 1-3 month Treasury bills)
# 1. GLD (SPDR ETF for gold)
# 1. JNK (SPDR ETF for high-yield debt)
# 1. MDY (SPDR ETF for S&P 400 mid-cap index)
# 1. SLY (SPDR ETF for S&P 600 small-cap index)
# 1. SPBO (SPDR ETF for corporate bonds)
# 1. SPMB (SPDR ETF for mortgage-backed securities)
# 1. SPTL (SPDR ETF for long-term Treasury bonds)

# ### Plot the SML for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks

# Use the past three years of daily returns data for the stocks listed on the [DJIA Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average).
# Compare the DJIA SML to the asset class SML above.

# ### Plot the SML for the five portfolios formed on beta

# Download data for portfolios formed on $\beta$ (`Portfolios_Formed_on_BETA`) from Ken French.
# For the value-weighted portfolios, plot realized returns versus $\beta$.
# These data should elements `[2]` and `[6]`, respectively.

# ### Estimate the CAPM $\beta$s on several levered and inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs)

# Try the following ETFs:
# 
# 1. SPY
# 1. UPRO
# 1. SPXU
# 
# Can you determine what these products do from the data alone?
# Estimate $\beta$s and plot cumulative returns.
# You may want to pick short periods of time with large market swings.

# ### Explore the size factor

# #### Estimate $\alpha$s for the ten portfolios formed on size

# Academics started researching size-based portfolios in the early 1980s, so you may want to focus on the pre-1980 sample.

# #### Are the returns on these ten portfolios formed on size concentrated in a specific month?

# #### Compare the size factor to the market factor

# You may want to consider mean excess returns by decade.

# ### Repeat the exercises above with the value factor

# ### Repeat the exercises above with the momentum factor

# You may find it helpful to consider the worst months and years for the momentum factor.

# ### Plot the coefficient estimates from a rolling Fama-French three-factor model for Berkshire Hathaway

# Use a three-year window with daily returns.
# How has Buffett's $\alpha$ and $\beta$s changed over the past four decades?

# ### Use the three-, four-, and five-factor models to determine how the ARKK Innovation ETF generates returns
