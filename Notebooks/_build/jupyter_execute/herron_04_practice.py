# ### Find the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio of MATANA stocks over the last three years

# Note that `sco.minimize()` finds *minimums*, so you need to minimize the *negative* Sharpe Ratio.

# ### Find the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio of MATANA stocks over the last three years, but allow short weights up to 10% on each stock

# ### Find the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio of MATANA stocks over the last three years, but allow total short weights of up to 30%

# ### Find the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio of MATANA stocks over the last three years, but do not allow any weight to exceed 30% in magnitude

# ### Find the minimum 95% Value at Risk (Var) portfolio of MATANA stocks over the last three years

# More on VaR [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk).

# ### Find the minimum maximum draw down portfolio of MATANA stocks over the last three years

# ### Find the minimum maximum draw down portfolio with all available data for the current Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks

# You can find the [DJIA tickers on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average).

# ### Plot the (mean-variance) efficient frontier with all available data for the current the DJIA stocks

# ### Find the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio with all available data for the current the DJIA stocks

# ### Compare the $\frac{1}{n}$ and maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolios with all available data for the current DJIA stocks

# Use all but the last 252 trading days to estimate the maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio weights.
# Then use the last 252 trading days of data to compare the $\frac{1}{n}$  maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolios.
