    "- Quiz 6 mean and median were about ~~90% and 96%~~  92% and 100%\n",
    "    - Please see the solution on Canvas and let me know if you have any questions\n",
    "    - Gradescope shows which hidden tests you missed\n",
    "    - I recently widened the tolerance on two hidden tests to give full credit if you minimized variance instead of volatility\n",
    "- I posted [project 2](project_02.ipynb) about Bitcoin and gold as inflation and market risk hedges\n",
    "- Next week (week of 4/10) is the assessment exam\n",
    "    - MSFQ students must take it for 5% of overall course grade \n",
    "    - Non-MSQF students do not take it and weight their grades by only 95%\n",
    "    - 20 multiple choice questions on the 6 core courses (corporate finance, investments, math, data analytics, empirical methods, and derivatives)\n",
    "    - ***You must be in the classroom during your assigned date and time to take the MSFQ assessment exam***\n",
    "    - If there is interest, we will discuss five stylized facts of asset returns after the MSFQ assessment exam\n",
    "    - We will also have our final quiz, quiz 7\n",
    "- The following week (week of 4/17) we will discuss Herron topic 5 (simulations)\n",
    "    - I will record a lecture video and complete a practice notebook\n",
    "    - But we will reserve class time for group work\n",
    "    - The class voted about 2-to-1 not to drop a topic, so this is a compromise, given that Monday is Patriot's Day holiday\n",
    "- The following week (week of 4/24) we will reserve class time for group work\n",
    "    - Project 2 is due Wednesday, 4/26, at 11:59 PM\n",
    "    - Teammates Review 2 is due Wednesday, 4/26, at 11:59 PM\n",

    "- ***Somewhere in there, please reserve 10 minutes to complete a TRACE review for this course***\n",
    "    - I cannot make you complete TRACE reviews\n",
    "    - But they are very helpful\n",
    "    - I change my courses every semester, hopefully for the better, based on TRACE reviews"
